Known bugs, errors and limitations of the code:

- Retrieving the filename of a selected font is missing.
- Browsing fonts shows the last selected font if SF was
  unable to display a font.

Possible future enhancements:

- Colors.
- Font size.
- Selecting a dir/file using a dialog or drag and drop.
- Font categories to filter the list.
- Predefined texts (e.g. all chars).
- Resizable dialog.
- Store dialog size and position.
- Pasting own texts into the Editor.
- Predefined Codepages.
- Font property editor.
- Print font overview.
- Set minimal dialog size.
- Hide size grip if it is destroying the content of controls.
- Dynamically open requested fonts.
- Do we need a toolbar?
